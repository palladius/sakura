## Script for Ricc video

Have you ever had a personal computer with disk close to 100% Apps get slower, you can't save documents anymore, and Chrome starts exploding? And what is it, a `docker image` or too many `node_modules` ?

Well, me too.

And since I'm a CLI guy, I've always solved it my fav way: with code. Bash, ruby, Python,  anything that would do the job. And the code had a mix of generic stuff and personal CUJs like
*  where I hold my git repos to look for `node_modules` or `bundled gems` or `virtualenvs` getting too big
* or `docker images`, and how the ones I care about are named.
* and so on.

How about moving to the next programming language.. English? (or italian of course).

Enter Gemini CLI. I've prepped my script in plain English with all my use cases, let's see what Gemini does. I've also instructed him to write readable markdowns with his findings / decisions, and so on.

Let's see

# Trash Info for ricc-macbookpro3

This file contains information about potential areas for disk space cleanup, based on our conversation on 2025-06-25.

## Key Findings

*   **Hostname:** `ricc-macbookpro3`
*   **Git Repositories:**
    *   The user wants to **preserve** the `node_modules` directory within `~/git/pvt-gemini20/mete-demo/` as it is for a live project.
    *   Other repositories, like `~/git/rubyevents`, had large `node_modules` that were removed.
*   **Media Folders:**
    *   `~/Pictures`: 15GB
    *   `~/Movies`: 49GB
    *   The `~/Movies` directory contains large GoPro videos from a trip to the Philippines in April 2024.
*   **Camtasia:**
    *   The user uses Camtasia, and temporary recordings (e.g., `Rec 6-25-2025 2.trec`) can be large. These are a good target for cleanup after projects are complete.
*   **Docker:**
    *   Docker was not running initially. When started, it only contained one small image. This may be worth checking again in the future.
*   **Other:**
    *   The `~/media` directory does not exist.

# Rails supports 4 frameworks:
# ./bin/rails javascript:install:[bun|esbuild|rollup|webpack]
# This scripts helps you understand which one you're using.
# This should be easy but, hey, for me its NOT.

# I asked BArd since i dont have a flu:

To determine which JavaScript framework you are currently using in your Rails 7.0 application, you can check for the existence of files associated with each framework. Here's how to identify the framework you're currently using:

Bun:

app/javascript/package.json: If this file exists and contains a dependency on Bun, then you are currently using Bun.
app/javascript/bun.js: If this file exists, then you are definitely using Bun.
Esbuild:

app/javascript/esbuild.js: If this file exists, then you are definitely using Esbuild.
config/importmap.rb: If this file contains the configuration for Esbuild, then you are currently using Esbuild.
Rollup:

app/javascript/rollup.config.js: If this file exists, then you are definitely using Rollup.
config/importmap.rb: If this file contains the configuration for Rollup, then you are currently using Rollup.
Webpack:

app/javascript/build: If this directory exists, then you are likely using Webpack.
config/webpack.config.js: If this file exists, then you are definitely using Webpack.
By checking for the existence of these files, you can determine which JavaScript framework is currently in use in your Rails 7.0 application.

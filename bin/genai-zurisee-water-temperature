    What is the water temperature today of the Zurich see? 
    If you can browse online, this should have the info you need: 
    https://www.zh.ch/de/umwelt-tiere/wasser-gewaesser/messdaten/wassertemperaturen.html . 
    A good point to measure is Zurich Tiefenbrunnen. 
    
    If you cannot browse online, please admit it since theres no other way to tell me that information. 
    
    Whatever info you give me, please quote your source and the date that that page was parsed.

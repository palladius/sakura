TODO:
- Make this ruby1.9 compliant
- OK make this a ruby gem (@bug see below)
- copy the lib/ structure from Rails (sittin gon shoulders of giants)

P3:
- [ ] Create a "hollow" safe version of the 'sakuric' gem.
      Goal: Update the gem on Rubygems with a version that contains ONLY a deprecation message and version info.
      Reason: Ensure existing installations don't break on update, but inform users of deprecation.
      Implementation:
        - Create a minimal gemspec (without 'echoe' if possible, or restore minimal build).
        - Create a simplified 'lib/sakuric.rb' (or separate build artifact) that just puts "Deprecated".
        - Ensure this doesn't break the local 'sakura-fanculo-sakuric' repo functionality which relies on the real 'lib/sakuric.rb'.

BUGS:
- binaries built from gem are exectued with Ruby, not SH, even if they have a
  bash she-bang

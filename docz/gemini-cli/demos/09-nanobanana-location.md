## About

A use case for generating an image based on the user's location, with a puffin in local attire.

## Location independent image

```markdown
Use Playwright MCP (or other tools like ipinfo.io) to navigate to a website which tells you WHERE we are located.
From that information (say "San Francisco, US" or "Argenta, Italy"), use that information to create an ad-hoc
Image generation prompt which is set in the city center and maybe around some famous thing in that city (or country, if unavailable for city).
Place a Puffin eating a Banana in the middle of that scene, with a very happy expression on its face.
The puffin should dress in some local-related job clothes.
Use a Pixar-like style, with bright colors and a sunny day.
Finally use Nanobanana MCP to actually GENERATE that image and rename the file to something where the title contains city/country and the overall theme.
The image should have a short caption on bottom with something like "Puffin in <CITY>, <Country>".
